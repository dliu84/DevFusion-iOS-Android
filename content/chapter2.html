        <p><strong>Introduction to Swift</strong></p>
        <p>
            Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. Introduced in 2014, it is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products.

        <p><strong>Why Choose Swift?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>1. Safe & Easy to Read:</strong> Swift's syntax and language constructions eliminate the types of unsafe code classes often found in C and Objective-C.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Fast & Powerful:</strong> Swift code is performance-optimized and can compete with C++ for computation algorithms.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Interoperability:</strong> Swift is designed to coexist with the Objective-C language, allowing you to incorporate Objective-C files into Swift projects and vice versa.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Memory Management:</strong> Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) for memory management, making it easier for developers.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Swift Basics: Variables, Constants, and Types</strong></p>
  
        <p><strong>Variables</strong></p>
        <p>
            Variables are named storage that our programs can manipulate. They are declared in Swift using the <code>var</code> keyword. For instance:
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><code>var age: Int = 25</code></p>
        </div>
  
        <p><strong>Constants</strong></p>
        <p>
            Constants are similar to variables, except the value cannot be changed once it's set. They are declared using the <code>let</code> keyword. For example:
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><code>let pi: Double = 3.14159</code></p>
        </div>
  
        <p><strong>Data Types</strong></p>
        <p>Swift has several basic data types:</p>
  
        <p><strong>1. Integers:</strong> Integers are whole numbers with no fractional component, such as 42 and -23. You declare integers with the <code>Int</code> keyword. For instance:</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><code>var number: Int = 10</code></p>
        </div>
  
        <p><strong>2. Doubles and Floats:</strong> These are used for floating-point numbers, or numbers with a fractional component. <code>Double</code> has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits, whereas the precision of <code>Float</code> can be as little as 6 decimal digits. For example:</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><code>var pi: Double = 3.14159</code></p>
        </div>
  
        <p><strong>3. Booleans:</strong> Boolean values are referred to as logical because they can only ever be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Swift uses the <code>Bool</code> type for boolean values. For instance:</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><code>var isActive: Bool = true</code></p>
        </div>
  
        <p><strong>4. Strings:</strong> Strings are sequences of characters, such as "hello, world". They are represented by the <code>String</code> type. For example:</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><code>var greeting: String = "Hello, world!"</code></p>
        </div>
  
        <p>
            Swift also supports complex data types like arrays, dictionaries, optionals, tuples, and many more which we'll explore in the upcoming classes.
        </p>

            Through practical coding exercises in the next lesson, you will gain hands-on experience with these basic elements of the Swift programming language. Stay tuned!
