      <p><strong>Introduction to Xcode and Interface Builder</strong></p>
      <p>
          Xcode is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provided by Apple for developers to create apps for its various platforms including iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
      </p>
      <p>
          Xcode provides a suite of tools including a source editor, interface builder, asset catalog, and many more. It also includes the iOS Simulator, where you can test your app without needing an actual device.
      </p>
      <p>
          Interface Builder is a software development application in Xcode's suite that allows developers to create graphical user interfaces for their apps. The Interface Builder allows you to create and design your app's UI visually, without having to write all the code by hand.

      <p><strong>Creating Your First iOS App</strong></p>
      <p>In this section, we'll create a simple "Hello, World!" iOS app.</p>
      <ol>
          <li>
              <strong>Create a new project:</strong> Open Xcode and choose "Create a new Xcode project". Then, select "App" under the iOS tab, and click "Next".
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Setup your project:</strong> Give your project a name (e.g., "HelloWorld") and make sure that "Swift" is selected as the language. Click "Next" and choose a location to save your project.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Understand the project structure:</strong> In the Project Navigator on the left, you'll see several files and folders. The two most important files for now are <code>SceneDelegate.swift</code> and <code>ViewController.swift</code>. The <code>SceneDelegate.swift</code> is the entry point of your app, and <code>ViewController.swift</code> contains the main logic for your app's main screen.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Design the interface:</strong> Go to <code>Main.storyboard</code>. Here you can design the user interface for your app. Drag a label from the Object Library onto the view and place it at the center of the screen. Change the text of the label to "Hello, World!".
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Run your app:</strong> To run your app, select the appropriate simulator from the toolbar (e.g., iPhone 11), and then click the "Play" button in the top left corner. You should see your "Hello, World!" message appear on the screen.
          </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Congratulations on building your first iOS app!</p>
